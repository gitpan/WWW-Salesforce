The following Perl module is to facilitate communication with the
Saleforce Web service APIs.

Note - This module is based off of Salesforce's Partner WSDL.
       Enterprise WSDLs are a little more tricky since code stubs
       must be generated on the fly. Stay tuned to SOAP::Lite's 
       wsdl2perl project which will make Enterprise WSDL's easier
       to deal with.

HISTORY

This Perl module was originally provided and presented as part of
the first Salesforce.com dreamForce conference on Nov. 11, 2003 in
San Francisco.

It is now being maintained by Chase Whitener.
