# Salesforce dot com Perl Module

The following Perl module is to facilitate communication with the
Saleforce Web service APIs.

Note - This module is based off of Salesforce's Partner WSDL.
       Enterprise WSDLs are a little more tricky since code stubs
       must be generated on the fly. Stay tuned to SOAP::Lite's 
       wsdl2perl project which will make Enterprise WSDL's easier
       to deal with.

HISTORY

This Perl module was originally provided and presented as part of
the first Salesforce.com dreamForce conference on Nov. 11, 2003 in
San Francisco.

It has been maintained by the original author and sforce developers
ever since.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  SOAP::Lite
  Crypt::SSLeay

WHAT WORKS

Almost all 6.0 API calls now work.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK (a.k.a. TO DO)

* create a convertLead method to access the 6.0 API function

* make login call an automatic one if the sessionId has not been
  provided - in other words, check first to see if user has set
  the sessionId, and if not, call login to fetch one. Otherwise,
  just use the provided one in the Session header.

* The TYPES global variable only dexcribes the Account datatype.
  Certain functions (like update and create) will require this
  hashmap to be updated with additional types, and their
  respective element data types.
